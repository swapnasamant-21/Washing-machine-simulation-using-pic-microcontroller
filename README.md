# Washing Machine Simulation using PIC Microcontroller

This project was developed as part of my Embedded Systems Internship at Emertxe (Mayâ€“June 2025)*.  
It simulates the working of a washing machine using a PIC microcontroller with PicsimLab for hardware simulation and MPLAB X IDE for programming.
